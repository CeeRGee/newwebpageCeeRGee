This is a practice repo to work  on and share with the public.

My intention with this repo is to showcase my progress with html and  css functions. I will ututilize all assignments attepmting to cover the assignemtns I didn't miss but also show I've been practicing. The web page I'll create is one I've finsished through Mimi an application for beginners in coding.

Here's a https://52muhh.mimo.run/index.html

Unfornatunatley its only avaible on Iphone but here's the link to the https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1133960732?pt=1335685&ct=share&mt=8

The approach I'll take will be deliberate in every step and or changes I make utilizing..

git add .
git commit -m "step/change i've made"
git push

To start I created a new repository for the project and made it public. The read me is self explaintory but I'm aware I need to show that I can fork and clone as well and that will come with time for now I'm start with this. While the Mimi code I created is HTML the process will allow me to work on CSS adding beuaty to the page. Since most of my work has been accunted for up unitl the last. I hope this shows my  commitment to coding and how much I want to continue with JTC.

I want to stree my focus is to show case:

Introduction to Flexbox
Growing and Shrinking
Axes Alignment
JS basics
