# newwebpageCeeRGee
This is a practice repo to work  on and share with the public.

My intention with this repo is to showcase my progress with html and  css functions. I will ututilize all assignments attepmting to cover the assignemtns I didn't miss but also show I've been practicing. The web page I'll create is one I've finsished through Mimi an application for beginners in coding.

Here's a https://52muhh.mimo.run/index.html

Unfornatunatley its only avaible on Iphone but here's the link to the https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1133960732?pt=1335685&ct=share&mt=8

The approach I'll take will be deliberate in every step and or changes I make utilizing..

git add .
git commit -m "step/change i've made"
git push

To start I created a new repository for the project and made it public. The read me is self explaintory but I'm aware I need to show that I can fork and clone as well and that will come with time for now I'm start with this. While the Mimi code I created is HTML the process will allow me to work on CSS adding beuaty to the page. Since most of my work has been accunted for up unitl the last. I hope this shows my  commitment to coding and how much I want to continue with JTC.

I want to stree my focus is to show case:

Introduction to Flexbox
Growing and Shrinking
Axes Alignment
JS basics


Certainly! Here’s a detailed explanation of each step in the provided CSS code:

### Image Styling

`Sure! Let’s break down each part of the CSS you provided:

1. General Page Styling

body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
    text-align: center;
}

	•	font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
This sets the font of the entire webpage to Arial. If Arial isn’t available, it falls back to any sans-serif font.
	•	margin: 0;
Removes the default margin around the entire page. By default, browsers apply some spacing around elements, and this resets it.
	•	padding: 0;
Similar to margin, it removes any inner spacing (padding) that the body might have.
	•	background-color: #f4f4f4;
This sets the background color of the entire webpage to a light gray (#f4f4f4).
	•	text-align: center;
This centers all inline and inline-block elements (such as text and images) inside the <body>. However, block elements like <div> and <h1> still need additional styling for centering.

2. Styling for the Image

img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    border-radius: 10px;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

	•	max-width: 100%;
Ensures that the image never exceeds the width of its container. This makes the image responsive, meaning it adjusts well on different screen sizes.
	•	height: auto;
Maintains the image’s aspect ratio while resizing, preventing distortion.
	•	border-radius: 10px;
Rounds the corners of the image slightly, giving it a smooth, modern look.
	•	box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
	•	This applies a subtle shadow around the image.
	•	0 → No horizontal offset
	•	4px → 4 pixels of vertical offset (shadow appears below the image)
	•	8px → Blur effect, making the shadow softer
	•	rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); → A semi-transparent black shadow (10% opacity).
